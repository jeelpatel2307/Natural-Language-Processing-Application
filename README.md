# Natural Language Processing Application

This is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) application built in Java using the Apache OpenNLP library. It demonstrates sentence detection and tokenization on a given input text.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Apache OpenNLP library and pre-trained models (download from the official website)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Download the pre-trained models for sentence detection (`en-sent.bin`) and tokenization (`en-token.bin`) from the Apache OpenNLP website.
3. Update the file paths in the `NLPApplication.java` file to point to the downloaded model files.
4. Build and run the application using your preferred Java development environment or from the command line.

## Application Overview

The `NLPApplication` class contains the main method and demonstrates the following NLP tasks:

1. **Sentence Detection**: The application loads the pre-trained sentence detection model and uses it to detect sentences in the input text.
2. **Tokenization**: For each detected sentence, the application loads the pre-trained tokenizer model and uses it to tokenize the sentence (split it into individual words or tokens).
3. **Output**: The detected sentences and their corresponding tokens are printed to the console.

You can modify the sample input text in the `main` method or provide alternative input sources (e.g., file, user input) to analyze different texts.

## Dependencies

This application uses the Apache OpenNLP library for natural language processing tasks. The required dependencies are:

- `opennlp-tools`: OpenNLP Tools library

These dependencies are automatically managed by your Java build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) or can be manually downloaded and included in your project's classpath.
